README

This is a quick README to confirm that this template appliation is to
serve as a scaffold to implement simple algorithms (or extend it
further) to use the source for static code analysis.

At the time of writing this file, the application has been used to
compare the performance of gcc-4.5 and clang-3.2 (binary and bitcode
interpreted versions). The results of comparisons would be included
here to help application maintainers select the best static analysers
and testing, verification tools.
